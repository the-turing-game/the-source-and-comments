# The source and comments
## The article authored by Mr. Turing in 1950
The article in the magazine "**Mind, a quarterly review in _psychology_ and philosophy**", 
opening the **LIX** volume of it, is entitled:
"I.—COMPUTING MACHINERY AND INTELLIGENCE" by A.M. Turing (see the facsimile of it attached).
The other parts of this volume include:
- II.—SUBJECT AND PREDICATE, by PETER THOMAS GEACH;
- III.—FREGE'S SINN UND BEDEUTUNG, by PAUL D. WIENPAHL;
- IV.—THE THEORY OF SOVEREIGNTY RESTATED, by W. J. REES;
- V.—A NOTE ON VERIFICATION, by FREDERICK C. COPLESTON;
- VI.—DISCUSSIONS, including  "THE EXISTENCE OF GOD" by THOMAS MCPHERSON;
- VII.—CRITICAL NOTICE, by C. D. BROAD;
- VIII.—NEW BOOKS, by MAURICE CRANSTON and MARTHA KNEALE.

...so, that you would get the idea of the overall context of it.

## The preamble
Let me quote: 
> If the meaning of the words "machine" and "think" are to be found by
examining how they are commonly used it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the
meaning and the answer to the question, "Can machines think?" is to be sought in a
statistical survey such as a Gallup poll. But this is absurd.

Mr. Turing is trying to tell us that deciding this question by a simple majority
voting is not a viable method ('absurd' - wildly unreasonable, illogical, or 
inappropriate), but somehow it sounds as a rejection of any measurable response 
of the Society at large to the experiments with automated deception that he is about to 
contemplate in the rest of the article...<br>
However! If you think about the procedure of training Large Language Models it is
almost exactly what he is describing as a "...statistical survey such as Gallup poll."
 I will just leave you with this thought here.

## The Turing Game
It is hard to believe that this text had been written by a person with training
in mathematics... First of all, it is more or less clear that the players A and B 
who are rigidly classified as 'man' (A) and 'woman' (B) are in the beginning of the 
game assigned symbolic names X and Y, but, instead of clearly indicating it 
author leaves us with the only option to guess it from the format of the questions 
given in quotes.

It gradually occurs to a meticulous enough reader, that not only the game is 
asymmetric in terms of classes/sex (only a man (A) is supposed to deceive the 
interrogator (C) the woman (B) is _not_ _required_ to deceive); more than that, she
is supposed to help the interrogator in discovering the deception! 
This asymmetry of goals as we will see changes the game from what is 
routinely called 'the Turing test' to a partly cooperative game with incomplete 
information, which is significantly more complex.

The third circumstance that comes out of the description is that players A and B
are _in the same room_ and consequently have complete information about
the answers and statements of each other! ...and, of course, that was the 'fun'
part (for other people present in the room) of the 'salon game' - the prototype 
of this 'Turing Game'. 

And then - this: 
> We now ask the question, "What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this
game?" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as
he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace
our original, "Can machines think?"

So... a Machine will take a place of a _man_ (A) and pretend to be a _woman_ (B) and by 
the frequency of _mistakes_ of a __deceived__ 'interrogator' (C) we will judge whether 
this particular Machine 'can think'...

## Other sources
I wanted to make a brief overview of the endless 'discussion' around this article, what it
_might_ mean and how this meaning can be utilized by our contemporaries in their
pursuit of tenure track positions and steady income. As it turned out the unknown 
author had already done that and posted a pretty exhaustive overview under the title 
[Turing Test](https://singularity2030.ch/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Wiki-Book-on-Turing-Test.pdf) on
the 'singularity2030' website. As Richard Feinman used to say: "If somebody has done it 
already - so the better for me." The article is pretty exhaustive and can enlighten
your winding path through the layers of fossilized 'interpretations' and sedimentary rocks
of 'objections'.

## The conclusion
And I quote:
>It might be urged that when playing the "imitation game" _**the best strategy for the
machine may possibly be something other than imitation of the behaviour of a man**_. This
may be, but I think it is unlikely that there is any great effect of this kind. In any case
there is no intention to investigate here the theory of the game, and it will be _**assumed**_ that
the best strategy is to try to provide answers that would naturally be given by a man.

Good to know (all the bold and italic highlighting is mine). If you, Mr. Turing 
didn't want to investigate your own game in 1950 - we will do it for you in 2024... if you don't mind.

In order to make it useful for this day and age I'm going to distill the definition of 
the game. It will require a bit of an [analysis](https://github.com/the-turing-game/the-analysis). 
If you are interested in reading my argumentaion and explanations you are welcome to
read it there.<br>
If you just want to get to the final definition and description of my version of the game - go
directly to 
[**The Game of Turing**](https://github.com/the-turing-game/the-game-of-turing). You can call it 
a different name if you want (I heard versions like "The game with super-intelligence", or 
"cooperation-deception game"), but and from now on I will call it "The Game of Turing" after 
the inventor of its initial version.
