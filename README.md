# The source and comments
It is hard to believe that this text had been written by a person with training
in mathematics... First of all, it is more or less clear that the players A and B 
who are rigidly defined as 'man' and 'woman' are in the beginning of the game
assigned symbolic names X and Y, but, instead of clearly saying it in the very 
beginning we are left with an option to guess it from the format of the question
given in quotes.

It gradually occurs to a meticulous enough reader, that not only the game is 
asymmetric in terms of sex (only a man (A) is supposed to deceive the 
interrogator (C) the woman (B) is _not_ supposed to deceive; more than that, she
is supposed to help the interrogator in discovering the deception! 
This asymmetry of strategies as we will see changes the the game from what is 
routinely called 'the Turing test' to a partly cooperative game with incomplete 
information, which is orders of magnitude more complex.

The third circumstance that comes out of the description is that players A and B
are _in the same room_ which means that they have complete information about
the answers and statements of each other!
