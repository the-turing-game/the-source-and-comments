A game which we call the 'imitation game' is played with three people, a man (A), a woman (B),
and an interrogator (C) who may be of either sex.  

The participants are located in two rooms isolated from each other. The interrogator (C) stays 
in a room apart front the other two; the participants A and B are in the same room and know
each others' answers and statements.

The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man 
and which is the woman. He knows them by labels X and Y, and at the end of the game he says 
either "X is A and Y is B" or "X is B and Y is A."

The interrogator is allowed to put questions to X and Y. If a question is addressed to X then 
X must answer. The answering participant is allowed to add statements to the answer.

The questions and answers are communicated between the two rooms by text messages.

It is A's object in the game to try and cause C to make the wrong identification.

The object of the game for the player B is to help the interrogator (C).
