A game which we call the 'imitation game' is played with three people, a man (A), a woman (B),
and an interrogator (C) who may be of either sex.  

The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other
two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by labels X and Y, and at the
end of the game he says either "X is A and Y is B" or "X is B and Y is A."

The interrogator stays in a room apart front the other two. The interrogator is allowed to put
questions to X and Y and they must answer. The questions and answers are communicated between 
the two rooms by a teleprinter.

It is A's object in the game to try and cause C to make the wrong identification.

The object of the game for the player B is to help the interrogator.
